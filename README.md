# DiscordBridgePlus
An extension the PMK744's DiscordBridge plugin. This plugin adds embeds for, players joining, players leaving, players dying, and even when they change skins. It also adds a -list command so it easy to tell who is on the realm from discord.

You will need to have the original DiscordBridge plugin with this to function properly.
